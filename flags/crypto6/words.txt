YOU ARE AT DEFCON 15!
NMAP IS A PORT SCANNER.
THERE IS NO SPOON

HUMAN KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE WORLD
I MADE A DISCOVERY TODAY. I FOUND A COMPUTER. WAIT A SECOND, THIS IS COOL. IT DOES WHAT I WANT IT TO. IF IT MAKES A MISTAKE, IT'S BECAUSE I SCREWED IT UP. NOT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LIKE ME... OR FEELS THREATENED BY ME... OR THINKS I'M A SMART ASS... OR DOESN'T LIKE TEACHING AND SHOULDN'T BE HERE... DAMN KID. ALL HE DOES IS PLAY GAMES.  THEY'RE ALL ALIKE. AND THEN IT HAPPENED... A DOOR OPENED TO A WORLD... RUSHING THROUGH THE PHONE LINE LIKE HEROIN THROUGH AN ADDICT'S VEINS, AN ELECTRONIC PULSE IS SENT OUT, A REFUGE FROM THE DAY-TO-DAY INCOMPETENCIES IS SOUGHT... A BOARD IS FOUND. "THIS IS IT... THIS IS WHERE I BELONG... "I KNOW EVERYONE HERE... EVEN IF I'VE NEVER MET THEM, NEVER TALKED TO THEM, MAY NEVER HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN... I KNOW YOU ALL...DAMN KID.  TYING UP THE PHONE LINE AGAIN.  THEY'RE ALL ALIKE... YOU BET YOUR ASS WE'RE ALL ALIKE... WE'VE BEEN SPOON-FED BABY FOOD AT SCHOOL WHEN WE HUNGERED FOR STEAK... THE BITS OF MEAT THAT YOU DID LET SLIP THROUGH WERE PRE-CHEWED AND TASTELESS.  WE'VE BEEN DOMINATED BY SADISTS, OR IGNORED BY THE APATHETIC. THE FEW THAT HAD SOMETHING TO TEACH FOUND US WILLING PUPILS, BUT THOSE FEW ARE LIKE DROPS OF WATER IN THE DESERT. THIS IS OUR WORLD NOW... THE WORLD OF THE ELECTRON AND THE SWITCH, THE BEAUTY OF THE BAUD.  WE MAKE USE OF A SERVICE ALREADY EXISTING WITHOUT PAYING FOR WHAT COULD BE DIRT-CHEAP IF IT WASN'T RUN BY PROFITEERING GLUTTONS, AND YOU CALL US CRIMINALS.  WE EXPLORE... AND YOU CALL US CRIMINALS.  WE SEEK AFTER KNOWLEDGE... AND YOU CALL US CRIMINALS.  WE EXIST WITHOUT SKIN COLOR, WITHOUT NATIONALITY, WITHOUT RELIGIOUS BIAS... AND YOU CALL US CRIMINALS. YOU BUILD ATOMIC BOMBS, YOU WAGE WARS, YOU MURDER, CHEAT, AND LIE TO US AND TRY TO MAKE US BELIEVE IT'S FOR OUR OWN GOOD, YET WE'RE THE CRIMINALS. YES, I AM A CRIMINAL.  MY CRIME IS THAT OF CURIOSITY.  MY CRIME IS THAT OF JUDGING PEOPLE BY WHAT THEY SAY AND THINK, NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. MY CRIME IS THAT OF OUTSMARTING YOU, SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME FOR. I AM A HACKER, AND THIS IS MY MANIFESTO. YOU MAY STOP THIS INDIVIDUAL, BUT YOU CAN'T STOP US ALL... AFTER ALL, WE'RE ALL ALIKE.
REMEMBER, HACKING IS MORE THAN JUST A CRIME. IT'S A SURVIVAL TRAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU, STONED OR STUPID? YOU DON'T HACK A BANK ACROSS STATE LINES FROM YOUR HOUSE, YOU'LL GET NAILED BY THE FBI.
It's in that place where I put that thing that time.
FYI man, alright. You could sit at home, and do like absolutely nothing, and your name goes through like 17 computers a day. 1984? Yeah right, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's livin' large. We have no names, man. No names. We are nameless! 
I hope you don't screw like you type.
Mess with the best, die like the rest.
Never fear, I is here.
Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
This *is* a payphone.
Type "cookie", you idiot.
Work hard today, or you'll work hard tomorrow trying to find a job.
We Russians don't drink any more. We now work on computers. We use computers to send viruses to the West and then we poach your money. We have the best hackers in the world.
If language is not correct, then what is said is not what is meant. If what is said is not what is meant, then what ought to be done remains undone.
The three characteristics of Perl programmers: mundaneness, sloppiness, and fatuousness.
First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then you win.
Javascript is the duct tape of the Internet.
Perl is like vise grips. You can do anything with it but it is the wrong tool for every job.

I'm not here to suck your dick, Stan. 
It's kinda like masturbation without the payoff.
Ignorance is bliss
Stop trying to hit me and hit me.
