Congratulations, you've somehow managed to get the secret message out of the source code.  Now 
you know why those spam messages are so horribly formatted!  You should realize that this flag 
can only be captured a limited number of times.  Once it's maxed out, it reverts to be owned by 
dc949, so I suggest you don't capture it while you currently have the flag, or you'll burn all 
the captures and it'll get shut off early and you'll score less points.  To capture this flag,
type all of this text into the text area.  Don't copy and paste, it won't work!
